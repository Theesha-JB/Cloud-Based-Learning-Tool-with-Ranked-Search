# Cloud-Based-Learning-Tool-with-ranked-search
We offer a basic design for the MRSE employing protected inner crop computing to address the difficulty of assisting such multi-keyword linguistic without isolation crack. Given the likely enormous number of on-demand data users and high number of sourced data documents in the cloud.
# Outline of the Project
The following is an overview of our contributions:
1. For the first time, we investigate the topics of multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data and suggest a set of rigorous privacy requirements for such a secure cloud data subsequently lead.
2. We describe two MRSE approaches based on the "coordinate matching" similarity metric that satisfy different privacy criteria in two different threat models.
3. We're working to improve our ranked search system so that it can handle more search semantics and dynamic data operations.
4. Experiments on a real-world data set are provided, as well as a full evaluation of the proposed schemes' privacy and efficiency guarantees.
